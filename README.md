## Features

> RESTful APIs for user management, product management, and order processing using Node.js and Express.js.
> Authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
> MongoDB database with schemas for users, products, orders, and payments.
> Data validation and error handling.
> Mock integrations for payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) and logistics providers.
> Secure communication using SSL/TLS.
> Security best practices such as input validation, rate limiting, and secure storage of sensitive information.
> Designed to handle a high volume of requests with optimized database queries and API performance.
> Prerequisites
> Node.js
> npm or yarn
> MongoDB
> SSL certificates (for production)

## Installation

```python
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/e-commerce-platform.git
cd e-commerce-platform
```

```python
Install dependencies:
npm install
```

> Set up environment variables by creating a .env file in the root directory and adding the following:

```json

NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
SSL_KEY_PATH=/path/to/your/ssl.key
SSL_CERT_PATH=/path/to/your/ssl.crt
```

## Configuration

> **MongoDB**: Make sure MongoDB is installed and running. Update MONGO_URI in the .env file with your MongoDB connection string.
> JWT Secret: Update JWT_SECRET in the .env file with your secret key for JWT.
> SSL Certificates: Obtain SSL certificates and set the paths for SSL_KEY_PATH and SSL_CERT_PATH in the .env file.
> Running the Application
> **Development Mode (HTTP):**

`npm run dev
`
**Production Mode (HTTPS):**

`npm start
`

## API Documentation

> The API endpoints are organized as follows:

**User Management: /api/users**

> Register a new user: POST /users/register
> Login a user: POST /users/login
> Get user profile: GET /users/profile

**Product Management: /api/products**

> Get all products: GET /product
> Get a product by ID: GET /product/:id
> Create a product (admin): POST /product
> Update a product (admin): PUT /product/:id
> Delete a product (admin): DELETE /product/:id

**Order Processing: /api/orders**

> Create an order: POST /order
> Get all orders (admin): GET /order
> Get order by ID: GET /order/:id
> Update order status (admin): PUT /order/:id
> Delete an order (admin): DELETE /order/:id

## Security Measures

> SSL/TLS: Secure communication using SSL/TLS certificates.
> Input Validation: Input validation using express-validator.
> Rate Limiting: Rate limiting using express-rate-limit.
> Secure Storage: Secure storage of sensitive information such as passwords using bcrypt.
> Scalability and Performance Optimization
> Clustering: Use clustering to take advantage of multi-core systems.
> Indexes: Optimize MongoDB queries using indexes.
> Lean Queries: Use lean queries to reduce overhead.
> Pagination: Implement pagination for large data sets.
